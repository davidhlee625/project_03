# Project 3 Submission: Webscraping Ebay

This project was a result of the prompts listed [here](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci040/tree/2022fall/project_03).

**What the `ebay-dl.py` file does:** 

This file takes in a search term and (optionally) number of pages and scrapes ebay, returning the number of pages specified for the specific search term in JSON file format. The JSON file returns a dictionary with the name, price (in cents), status, shipping costs (in cents), whether free returns are possible, and the number of items sold.
